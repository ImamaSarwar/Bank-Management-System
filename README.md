# Fort Nox- Bank Management System
Fort Nox is a basic console-based bank management system developed in C++ that demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as function overloading, dynamic memory allocation, and struct composition.
### Implementation Details & Constraints
Designed under strict programming constraints, including no use of the string class or any inbuilt functions, the project encourages hands-on problem solving, deep understanding of character arrays, and low-level memory manipulation. Fort Nox simulates a simplified banking environment where users can open accounts, search and update customer information, and display all existing accounts, all while working with raw pointers and manually managed memory.
## Features
- Open new customer accounts with unique account numbers (PK001 to PK100)
- Search for a customer by account number
- Update customer address 
- Update customer phone number 
- Update customer balance 
- Display details of all customers
## Concepts Demonstrated
- Structures and Classes
- Function Overloading
- Dynamic Memory Allocation with new
- Pointers and Arrays of Pointers
- Modular Programming
